# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

QR Attendance API is a Laravel 12 application that manages event attendance through QR code scanning with geolocation verification. The system allows users to check in to events by scanning QR codes, validates their proximity to the event location, and tracks attendance records.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Laravel 12 (PHP 8.2+)
- **Frontend**: Livewire 3 + Tailwind CSS 3.4 + Flowbite
- **UI Components**: WireUI 2.4 + Rappasoft Livewire Tables 3.7
- **Authentication**: Laravel Jetstream 5.3 (Livewire stack) + Sanctum 4.0 (API tokens)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6
- **Testing**: PHPUnit 11

## Core Architecture

### Triple Interface System

The application has three distinct interfaces:

1. **Web Interface** (`routes/web.php`): Jetstream-powered dashboard with Livewire components
2. **Admin Interface** (`routes/admin.php`): Mounted at `/admin` prefix with `['web', 'auth']` middleware (configured in `bootstrap/app.php`), uses custom AdminLayout component
3. **API Interface** (`routes/api.php`): RESTful API with Sanctum authentication for mobile/external clients

### Key Models & Relationships

- **User**: Authenticatable with Sanctum tokens, optional employee_id linking
- **Employee**: External employee registry (non-timestamped, matricula as primary key)
- **Event**: QR-enabled attendance events with geolocation boundaries
  - Auto-generates UUID-based QR codes on creation
  - Has `isActive()` method checking: active flag, start_time, end_time
  - Relationships: belongsTo User (creator), hasMany Attendances
- **Attendance**: Pivot-like model tracking event check-ins with geolocation data
  - Stores user coordinates, calculated distance, verification status
  - Relationships: belongsTo Event, belongsTo User

### Employee Verification System

Users register with an `employee_id` (matricula):
- System checks if matricula exists in `employees` table
- Status set to `active` if found, `pending_verification` if not
- Auth flow validates against Employee model for verification

### Geolocation Service

`GeolocationService` handles distance calculations between user location and event location using the Haversine formula. Used in `AttendanceController::checkIn()` to verify users are within `allowed_radius` of events.

### API Authentication Flow

1. **Register/Login**: Returns Sanctum token with 2-hour expiry
2. **Token Usage**: Include as Bearer token in Authorization header
3. **Logout**: Deletes current access token
4. **Check Status**: Rotates token (deletes old, creates new with 2hr expiry)

## Development Commands

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment file (if not exists)
cp .env.example .env

# Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# Install Node dependencies
npm install

# Generate app key
php artisan key:generate

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# Link storage
php artisan storage:link
```

### Development Server
```bash
# Start all services (server, queue, vite) concurrently
composer dev

# Or run individually:
php artisan serve          # Laravel dev server (port 8000)
php artisan queue:listen   # Queue worker
npm run dev                # Vite dev server
```

### Testing & Code Quality
```bash
# Run test suite (clears config first)
composer test

# Run Laravel Pint (code style fixer)
./vendor/bin/pint

# View real-time logs
php artisan pail
```

### Building for Production
```bash
# Build frontend assets
npm run build

# Optimize application
php artisan optimize
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# Rollback migrations
php artisan migrate:rollback

# Fresh migrations with seeding
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# Create new migration
php artisan make:migration create_table_name

# Create new seeder
php artisan make:seeder TableSeeder
```

### Code Generation
```bash
# Create controller (API)
php artisan make:controller api/ControllerName --api

# Create model with migration and factory
php artisan make:model ModelName -mf

# Create Livewire component
php artisan make:livewire ComponentName

# Create service class
php artisan make:class Services/ServiceName
```

## Important Configuration

### Localization
- Default locale: Spanish (`es`)
- Supported: Spanish, English
- Language files in `lang/es/` and `lang/en/`
- Use `laravel-lang/common` for standardized translations

### Jetstream Configuration
- Stack: Livewire (not Inertia)
- Features enabled: Profile photos, Account deletion
- Features disabled: API, Teams, Terms & Privacy Policy
- Auth guard: `sanctum`
- Profile photos stored on `public` disk

### API Token Expiry
Sanctum tokens expire after 2 hours. Frontend clients should:
1. Handle 401 responses
2. Use `/api/check-status` endpoint to rotate tokens
3. Store new token and retry failed request

## Key API Endpoints

### Public Routes
- `POST /api/register` - User registration with employee_id
- `POST /api/login` - Authentication (returns 2hr token)
- `POST /api/validate-matricula` - Check if employee matricula exists
- `GET /api/events/qr/{qrCode}` - Get event details by QR code

### Protected Routes (Sanctum)
- `POST /api/logout` - Invalidate current token
- `GET /api/profile` - Get authenticated user
- `GET /api/check-status` - Rotate token
- `GET /api/events` - List events
- `GET /api/events/{event}` - Get single event details
- `POST /api/events` - Create event
- `DELETE /api/events/{event}` - Delete event
- `POST /api/attendances` - Check in to event (requires qr_code, user_latitude, user_longitude)
- `GET /api/attendances/my` - User's attendance history
- `GET /api/attendances/my/stats` - User attendance statistics
- `GET /api/attendances/event/{event}` - Event attendances (admin only)

## Common Development Patterns

### Creating a New API Endpoint
1. Add route in `routes/api.php` (public or in auth:sanctum group)
2. Create controller method in `app/Http/Controllers/api/`
3. Use `Validator::make()` for input validation
4. Return JSON with consistent structure:
   ```php
   return response()->json([
       'success' => true|false,
       'message' => 'Description',
       'data' => [...],
   ], HTTP_CODE);
   ```

### Adding Admin Features
1. Add route in `routes/admin.php`
2. Use AdminLayout component for views (`resources/views/components/admin-layout.blade.php`)
3. Routes are automatically protected by `['web', 'auth']` middleware (configured in `bootstrap/app.php`)
4. Check user permissions with `$user->isAdmin()` method if needed

### Working with Geolocation
1. Inject `GeolocationService` in controller constructor
2. Use `calculateDistance()` method with event and user coordinates
3. Compare result against event's `allowed_radius` property
4. Store calculated distance in attendance record

## Testing Notes

- Test configuration in `phpunit.xml` uses SQLite in-memory database
- Jetstream includes feature tests for auth flows (registration, login, password reset, 2FA, profile management)
- When writing new tests, use existing Jetstream tests as patterns
- API tests should test both authenticated and unauthenticated scenarios
- Test geolocation logic with various distance scenarios (within/outside radius)

## Additional Notes

### Queue Configuration
- Queue driver: `database` (production)
- Queue jobs stored in database table
- Run queue worker with `php artisan queue:listen --tries=1` or use `composer dev`

### Application Configuration
- App name: "Secci√≥n8" (configurable in `.env`)
- Default locale: Spanish (`es`)
- Session driver: `database` (2 hours lifetime)
- Cache driver: `database`
